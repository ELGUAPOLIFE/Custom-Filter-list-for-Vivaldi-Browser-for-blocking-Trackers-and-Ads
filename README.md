# Get Brave level adblocking on Vivaldi browser by adding these lists ⚙️Without Any Extensions⚙️

# Filter combination for Vivaldi's Built-in Adblocker

Allow every list to use ABP Snippet rules. Don't use any unnecessary extra filters with the lists below. It can reduce the blocking capability of these filters, specially the wrong combinations of AdGuard, ABP anti-CV and HaGeZi filters.

⭐ Built-in lists ⭐ ( Compliment for other filters )

1. DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar ( https://downloads.vivaldi.com/ddg/tds-v2-current.json )
2. EasyPrivacy ( https://downloads.vivaldi.com/easylist/easyprivacy-current.txt )

4. Fanboy's Annoyance list ( https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-annoyance.txt )
    EasyList Cookie List and Fanboy's Social Blocking List are already included, there is no need to subscribe to them if you already have Fanboy's Annoyance List.

⭐ AdGuard Filter lists ⭐ ( Must include )

These 3 links are taken from AdGuard's official site ( https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/adguard-filters/#adguard-filters ) .
Make sure use these exact 3 links, not other mirrors of a same filter. Don't use any of HaGeZi's lists with these 3 lists.

8. AdGuard Annoyances Filter ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/master/filters/filter_14_Annoyances/filter.txt )

16. Malicious URL Blocklist Vivaldi ( https://malware-filter.gitlab.io/malware-filter/urlhaus-filter-vivaldi.txt )

By using these filters I was able to block 99% Ads and Tracker on https://adblock.turtlecute.org/ and got 100 out of 100 on https://adblock-tester.com/. Though It is very hard to block YouTube and Facebook ads actively without any extension because big techs always host ads from their own domains, use dynamic content, and change structure over and over again.
